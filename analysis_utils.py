    Perform a psychometric curve analysis of the data in the staircase and
    save a figure, if needed.

    Parameters
    ----------

    amp: float array
        The magnitude of the signal 
    c: float/int array
       The correct value in each trial (0/1), -1 for no response.
       
    guess: The expected hit rate when the subject is blind-folded (default:
    0.5)

    flake: The expected rate of misses on trials on which the subjects
    should actually succeed, if they are really doing the task (default: 0.1)

    slope: The slope of the psychometric curve at the inflection point
    (default to 3.5)

    fig_name: string
       A file name for saving a figure. If none provided, don't save the
       generated figure

    bootstrap_n: int
       The number of boot samples to take for the bootstrapping analysis

    Note
    ----

    The fitting procedure is applied to the slope, as well as to the
    threshold.
